Game mode description (recommended to read)：
  Each level of the game has hidden items, you need to find and collect them and then pass the level to unlock the next level, 
  if you do not collect and pass the level will not unlock the next level, each hidden item will give a riddle, hope you can find. 
  (See Mystery.txt file). Remember to save the game after getting the hidden items, otherwise the items will disappear after death.

Reminder：
  Make it a good habit to save the game, otherwise it will be hard to survive without the archive.

  If you saved the game before, make sure you go to the right archive next time and enter the "LoadGame" portal instead of choosing a new difficulty,
  otherwise the game will continue on that new difficulty and overwrite your old archive (if you saved in the new one).
